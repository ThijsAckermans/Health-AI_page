  "introContent": "The Health-AI project addresses the limited accessibility and availability of health data within the Dutch health sector, hindering AI applications' development. Facing issues like administrative inefficiencies and workforce retention, the project aligns with the 2022 \"Integraal Zorgakkoord\" (IZA), projecting future workforce needs and health cost increases.\n\nAI offers solutions, optimizing resources, enhancing patient involvement, and streamlining tasks, but privacy concerns surround patient data access. The project proposes a transformative solution through **federated AI development and validation**, establishing a secure ecosystem for collaboration among stakeholders.\n\nThe goal is to revolutionize data accessibility for cost-effective, efficient, and equitable health delivery.",
