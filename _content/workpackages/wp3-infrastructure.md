## Overview

Work Package 3 builds the **technical backbone** that makes federated AI possible. Led by SURF and Health-RI, this work package delivers the infrastructure needed for secure, privacy-preserving AI development.

### Key Components

- **Federated Learning Platform** - Software infrastructure for distributed model training
- **Secure Computation Environments** - Protected spaces for AI algorithm execution
- **Communication Protocols** - Secure channels for exchanging model updates
- **Monitoring & Logging** - Tools for tracking system performance and security

### Technology Stack

Our infrastructure leverages:

- Dutch national research infrastructure (SURF)
- Health-RI's health data infrastructure
- Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)
- Open-source federated learning frameworks
