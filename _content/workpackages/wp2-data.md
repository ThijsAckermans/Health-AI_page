## Overview

Work Package 2 focuses on the critical foundation of any AI system: **high-quality, accessible data**. In healthcare, this presents unique challenges due to privacy regulations and the sensitive nature of patient information.

### FAIR Principles

We implement the FAIR data principles to ensure health data is:

- **Findable** - Data can be discovered by humans and machines
- **Accessible** - Clear protocols for data retrieval
- **Interoperable** - Data works with other datasets and systems
- **Reusable** - Data is well-documented for future use

### Federated Approach

Our federated approach means data **stays where it is**. Instead of centralizing patient data, we bring algorithms to the data sources, ensuring:

- Compliance with GDPR and healthcare regulations
- Institutional data governance is maintained
- Patient privacy is protected by design
