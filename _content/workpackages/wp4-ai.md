## Overview

Work Package 4 is the **heart of Health-AI**, representing 66% of the project effort. Here, cutting-edge AI algorithms are developed, trained, and validated using real patient data in a federated setting.

### Focus Areas

#### High TRL Solutions
We aim for Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 6-8, meaning our solutions are validated in real healthcare environments and ready for deployment.

#### Open Source
All AI software developed in Health-AI will be **open source**, enabling:
- Transparency in AI decision-making
- Reproducibility of results
- Adoption across the healthcare sector

#### Use Cases
Our AI solutions are validated against real-world clinical use cases from consortium partners including:
- Academic medical centers (Radboudumc, UMCG, Maastricht University)
- Cancer institutes (NKI-AVL, MAASTRO)
- Regional hospitals (Isala)

### AI Techniques

- Federated Learning algorithms
- Privacy-preserving machine learning
- Explainable AI (XAI) methods
- Multi-modal data integration
