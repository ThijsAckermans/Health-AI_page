## What is Federated AI?

Traditional machine learning requires collecting all data in one central location to train AI models. In healthcare, this creates significant challenges:

- **Privacy concerns**: Patient data is highly sensitive
- **Regulatory barriers**: GDPR and other regulations restrict data movement
- **Technical challenges**: Medical data is often stored in incompatible formats
- **Institutional resistance**: Hospitals are reluctant to share competitive advantages

**Federated AI** offers a revolutionary solution: instead of moving data to the algorithm, we bring the algorithm to the data.

## How Does It Work?

In a federated learning setup:

1. Each participating institution keeps its data locally
2. A shared AI model is distributed to all participants
3. Each institution trains the model on its local data
4. Only model updates (not data) are shared
5. Updates are combined to improve the global model
6. The process repeats until the model reaches optimal performance

## Why This Matters for Healthcare

### Better AI Models

Healthcare AI models trained on data from a single institution often fail when applied elsewhere. Federated learning enables training on diverse datasets from multiple institutions, creating more robust and generalizable models.

### Privacy by Design

Patient data never leaves the hospital. Only mathematical model updates are shared, making it virtually impossible to reconstruct individual patient information.

### Regulatory Compliance

Federated AI aligns with GDPR's data minimization principle by eliminating the need to centralize sensitive data.

### Enabling Collaboration

Institutions can collaborate on AI development without the complex legal agreements typically required for data sharing.

## The Health-AI Approach

The Health-AI project takes federated learning to the next level by:

- Developing **open-source** federated AI solutions
- Building **secure infrastructure** specifically designed for healthcare
- Ensuring data is **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
- Creating **high TRL** (Technology Readiness Level) solutions ready for real-world deployment
