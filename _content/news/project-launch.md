We are thrilled to announce the official launch of the **Health-AI** project on January 1st, 2025!

## A Major Step Forward for Healthcare AI in the Netherlands

Funded by the AiNed program via AIC4NL with a total budget of €8.2 million, Health-AI represents a groundbreaking collaboration between 16 leading organizations from academia, industry, and healthcare institutions across the Netherlands.

## Our Mission

Health-AI aims to develop **federated AI solutions** that enable healthcare institutions to collaboratively train AI models while keeping sensitive patient data secure within their own walls. This approach addresses one of the biggest challenges in healthcare AI: leveraging diverse, multi-institutional data while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security.

## The Consortium

Our consortium brings together an exceptional mix of expertise:

- **Medical Data Works B.V.** serves as the project coordinator
- Leading academic medical centers including **Maastricht University**, **Radboudumc**, and **UMCG**
- Technology leaders like **Philips**, **TNO**, and **SURF**
- Healthcare providers including **Isala**, **NKI-AVL**, and **MAASTRO Clinic**
- Innovative companies such as **Branchkey**, **Roseman Labs**, **IQVIA**, and **Linksight**
- Infrastructure partners **Health-RI** and **Brightlands**

## What's Next

Over the coming months, our teams will be working intensively across four main work packages:

1. **Coordination** - Ensuring smooth project management and communication
2. **Data** - Making health data FAIR within federated settings
3. **Infrastructure** - Building secure technical foundations
4. **AI** - Developing and validating federated AI solutions

Stay tuned for updates on our progress as we work towards transforming healthcare through responsible AI innovation!
