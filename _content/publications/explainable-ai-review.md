## Abstract

This paper reviews the current state of explainable artificial intelligence in healthcare applications, with a focus on clinical decision support systems. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, understanding how these systems reach their conclusions is critical for physician trust and patient safety.

## Key Findings

- Explainability methods vary significantly in their effectiveness across different AI architectures
- Clinical adoption of AI requires transparent decision-making processes
- Regulatory frameworks are evolving to mandate AI explainability in healthcare
